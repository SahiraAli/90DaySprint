I have a new update

A 90Day long sprint for your preparation and cracking your next opportunities.  An initiative by Sandip :)

### Feb week1
- Hi all, I'm Sandip ur junior from 3rd year. This is a small initiative I and Sahira took to keep you'll focused and motivated throughout this prep time. I know things are not going as planned. Since we have last time, we can't waste on silly things. Whatever small things I can help with be it in projects, interview prep or making up presentable resumes I'll try to help. Only if you all support it.
